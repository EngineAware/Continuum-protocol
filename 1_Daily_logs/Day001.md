## Analysis
First day of learning gave me way of being real towards the process.It gave me to see the pattern how everything are connected
to each other in a way that makes this perfect world not a byproduct.Truly i'm into it.

## Next Steps
- Continue structured progression in each resource
- Begin connecting concepts across domains
