Day006
## Book Progress
**Book:** Basic Math & Pre-Algebra – Mark Zegarelli  
**Pages Studied:** 25 → 29  
**Total Study Time:** 2 hours  

---

## Topic
Rounding Whole Numbers (Nearest 10, 100, 1000)

---

## Concepts Learned
- How rounding works based on place value (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands)  
- Rounding rules: 1–4 round down, 5–9 round up  
- Rollover rounding when rounding up changes larger place values (e.g., 99501 → 100000)  
- Why rounding is useful for estimation and simplifying numbers  

---

## Examples Practiced
- Small-number rounding: 70, 130, 290  
- Nearest 10/100/1000: 200, 900, 1200, 8000, 12000, 39000  
- Rollover rounding:  
  - 7642 → 8000  
  - 99501 → 100000  
- Additional mixed examples from notebook  

---

## Problems Completed
(Total: 20+ rounding problems)
- Nearest 10  
- Nearest 100  
- Nearest 1000  
- Multiple rollover scenarios  

---

## Key Concepts (Core Takeaways)
- Identify the rounding place  
- Look at the digit immediately to the right  
- Apply the rounding rule (down for 1–4, up for 5–9)  
- Replace all digits after the rounding place with zeros  
- Understand rollover propagation (e.g., 999 → 1000)

## Progress Status
Completed pages 25–29.  
**Next Topic:** Page 29 – Column Line-Up for Addition and Subtraction.

## Notes
Rounding rules and rollover behavior are now clear and correctly applied.
