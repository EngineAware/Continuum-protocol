## Current Book
**Electronics for Beginners: A Practical Introduction** by Jonathan Barelet
**Chapter:**1 and 2 half
## Topics Learned Today

### Core Concepts
-**ELectrostatics discarge (Esd)**
-Risks of static electricity to electronic components
-Proper handling prevention methods

-Units and Measurements**
-SI units system in eletroncis
-Water pipe analogy for electrical concepts
-Used Chatgpt to better understand analogies

### Technical Topics
-**Frequency**
-Basic concepts
-Frequency loops or repettion is the tools not final product
-**understanding**
-A 1Hz clock ticks once per second
-An LED binking at 5 Hz blinks 5 times per second
- A processor running at 1 Ghz has fundamental clock that cycles 1 billion times per second
- 5 Hz = 5 blinks per second
- 1 billion Ghz = 1 billion blinks per second
- so i understand that it doesn't just do one kind of activities per-second but differnt kind.

  ## Book change update
  **Switched from:** *Makes:Electronics* by Charles Platt
  **Reason**
  -Previous book pace was too slow
  -Needed more direcr with deep and fast-paced content
