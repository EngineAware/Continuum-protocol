🧠 Continuum Protocol
**Building the Infinity Scanner**
An open-source, non-invasive device concept to capture high-fidelity data of the self —
the first hardware step toward preventing *information-theoretic death.*
---
##
🌌 The Mission
First step towards the **core of every intelligence species** — existence itself.
Without solving the core, everything else becomes meaningless.
This project aims to explore, understand, and preserve the informational essence of life.
---
##
🧩 The Project
The conscious self is a **dynamic signal**, and the **body** is its **temporary transmitter**.
This project represents the beginning of an antenna-array design capable of capturing that
signal with the highest possible fidelity —
creating the first true *backup* of human consciousness.
Every step of this journey, from concept to creation, is documented and justified through daily
learning and experimentation.

📚 Description
A **daily learning journey** to build the foundation required for the Continuum Protocol.
Starting completely from **zero**, I’m learning:
-
-
-

-
-
🐍🦀 Python
— for software and AI foundations
Rust — for high-performance and low-level systems
⚡🧮 Electronics
— understanding physical computation
Mathematics — the core logic behind all systems
🧬💻 Biology
— the blueprint of living information
Computer Science — to connect the digital and biological worlds
This phase focuses on learning, experimenting, and documenting everything openly.
Each log represents progress toward building the core of everything — **understanding self as
signal**.
