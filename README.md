# Continuum-protocol
Building the Infinity scanner:An open-source, non-invasive device to caputure the high fidelity data self.The first hardware step toward preventing information theortic death.

## The misson
First step towards the core of every intelligence species which is existence itself without solving the core everything is meaningless for the process

## Project
The conscious self is a dynamic signal,and the body is its temporary transmitter.This project is the beginning of an antenna array designed to capture that signal with the highest possible fidelity,creating the first true backup of a human consciousness.

Process is documented daily,The work is its own justification.
